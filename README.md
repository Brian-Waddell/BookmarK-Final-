Welcome to Bookmark application the goal of this web based ruby application is for users to post comments about different books they have read. 
The goal of the application is for mainly school kids so they may be able to comminicate with each other over long distances. Book clubs could also 
benefit from the use of this tool. 


Pain Point- The problem I am addressing has to deal with connecting people avid and novel readers. 

Trying to host an in person book discussion becomes hard to find time and the physical space. 

User Story 

As a user, I want to be able to search for books by their name that will allow me to quickly find interesting groups to join

As a user, I want to register for an account to create and manage my book club groups

As a user, I want a dashboard that shows the groups that I am apart of and give me quick acccess to these groups.

As a user, I want to be able to upload a profile picture, so that I can personalize my profile.
